# Research log

The single narrative doc.  Historical numbers below were reported from
`experiments/nbody_benchmark.py`, but the referenced `runs/nbody_benchmark.json` artifact is absent
from the current checkout.  They are therefore not independently reproducible here.  Retractions and
scope downgrades are reported in place, loudly, naming the check that failed.

## 2026-08-03 — **SCOPE DOWNGRADE: legacy N-body results are smoke only**

The 2026-07-29 table below must not be used as evidence that one GP framework beats another.  A data
and harness audit found four material problems:

1. the legacy generator redraws particle masses for every trajectory but does not include masses in
   `X`, so pooled rows do not represent one well-defined Hamiltonian regression function;
2. the benchmark splits individual rows, allowing states from the same trajectory into train and
   test rather than measuring trajectory-level generalization;
3. label-based gradient filtering occurs before the split; and
4. the exact arm is under-solved, while the TERA wrapper does not propagate the outer benchmark seed
   and its custom gradient path has no independent regression suite.

The missing run artifact is an additional reproducibility failure.  None of these facts makes the
reported arithmetic imaginary, but together they invalidate any confirmatory or SOTA interpretation.
The table is retained below only as historical smoke output.

A separate companion generator, `data/generate_nbody_confirmatory.py`, now fixes masses per task
replica, persists trajectory/time IDs and full configuration, creates deterministic disjoint
trajectory-group splits, computes normalization from training groups only, performs no label-based
filtering, validates gradients and energy drift, and writes a SHA-256 manifest.  Baselines must be
rerun on frozen companion corpora before a predictive claim is considered.
